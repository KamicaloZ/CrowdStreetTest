# CrowdStreetTest
My submission for the CrowdStreet interview


To get started, for Ubuntu, use the following (probably as sudo) in order to get the system libraries you need:

$ apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb


Next, make sure you are in the directory you want to put this project in, and run:

$ npm install cypress --save-dev


Next, run:

$ npx cypress open

This will initialize the test runner server, and boot up your first demo tests.  None of them are mine, but let's take a look at some of mine.

$ npm install typescript --save-dev
